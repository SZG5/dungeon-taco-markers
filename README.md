## Installation

(Future) ~~If you have BlishHUD, you can simply download them from the menu.~~

### Manual Method
Download the latest FvD_Dungeon_Guide.taco from the [release page](https://github.com/SZG5/gw2-dungeon-markers/releases) (or **Direct Download:** [latest version](https://github.com/SZG5/gw2-dungeon-markers/releases/latest/download/FvD_Dungeon_Guide.taco))

Place the .taco file in the correct folder for markers.

#### BlishHUD (Manual)
1) Find your blishhud folder. (On windows OS, if you have the shortcut, you can right click and click Open File Location)
2) Find the settings folder
3) Find the markers folder
4) Place the .taco in the marker folder. 
5) Restart BlishHUD and then check that the marker pack is enabled. 

The folder path might look something like this. Blish.HUD.0.11.7\settings\markers 

#### TacO (Unadvised but it can work, but less clean)
1) Find your TacO folder. (On windows OS, if you have the shortcut, you can right click and click Open File Location)
2) Click the POI folder and place the .taco in the folder. 
3) Restart TacO and then check that the marker pack is enabled. 

The Taco folder path might look something like GW2TacO_066r\POIs

**NOTICE:** These markers were created with BlishHUD in mind. More than likely the info sections will run off the screen in TacO. It's generally a worse experience. I highly recommend transfering over to BlishHUD. You can get it at: https://blishhud.com/
